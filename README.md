# DiaCARS.jl

DiaCARS.jl is a tool to simulate complex susceptibilities used to generate CARS spectra for various diatomic molecules. Currently supported: N2, O2, CO

## How to use it?
It is not meant to be used stand alone (although some simple spectral generation is implemented, but only lightly tested). Instead, its purpose is to produce theoretical complex susceptibilities to build up a library of compressed spectra using [CARS.jl](https://github.com/tudarsm/cars.jl) which can be used to fit experimental spectra. For examples, check out the documentation of CARS.jl.
